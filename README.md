Refactoring existing Shenandoah themes. Adding options for editorial staff to modify all settings directly from the WP dashboard. 



This theme originally based on the starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`.


* IMPORTANT: use at your own risk. This code, for now, is all highly customized for Shenandoah
